## üèÖ Frontend Team Badge from my Team Lead at [Portal.ir](https://www.portal.ir/) - Meticulous Coder 
This badge was awarded to me for writing **clean, organized, and highly detailed code**.  
Paying attention to the smallest details in coding not only improves the overall quality of a project,  
but also makes its future maintenance and development simpler and more reliable.
